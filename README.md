## Why
  I struggled with understanding Java Lambdas and Generics. 
  I went to ChatGPT to come up with a project idea using Lambdas and Generics.

## Results
  I gained a better understanding on lambdas and genrics. I also improved my exception handling skills. 

## Approach

  ### Description
  
    Create a command-line calculator in Java that can perform various mathematical operations 
    on different data types using generics. Users can choose the operation they want to perform 
    (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication) and input the operands. 
    Lambdas can be used to define the specific operation for each data type.

  ### Key Features
  
    1. Support for Multiple Data Types: 
    Implement generic methods to support different data types, such as integers, doubles, and more.
    
    2.  User Interface: 
    Allow users to choose the operation they want to perform (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication)
    and input the operands.
    
    3. Lambda Expressions for Operations: 
    Use lambda expressions to define the mathematical operations for each data type. 
    For example, you can have lambda expressions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
    
    4. Error Handling: 
    Implement basic error handling to handle invalid input and division by zero.
    
    5. Reusability: 
    Make your calculator extensible so that additional operations can be added easily in the future.
